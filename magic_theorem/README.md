## Description

> 1 + 1 just me and you <3

This is my first Beatblock level ever, I hope it's fun! I initially tried to design a really easy level for beginners, but uhh I think I made a challenge for beginners instead. It's not very easy but not hard either, though if you want a hard level, I recommend playing this on higher speed, I found that it's also really fun that way!
