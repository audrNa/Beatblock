## Description

> Stop dancing! Stop dancing and help me out here!

This is my second level ever. This time I decided to chart a 44 second song instead of a 4 minute one (lol). This time the difficulty is way harder, and I also experimented with adding lyrics and various other stuff. This also has another version with Japanese metadata and lyrics.

At this time I am also very busy with other things, so I don't have much time to make levels. :(
